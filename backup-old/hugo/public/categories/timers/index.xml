      <description>Below are some notes I wrote while studying hrtimer slack behavior (range timers), which was added to reduce wakeups and save power, in the commit below. The idea is that:&#xA;Normal hrtimers will have both a soft and hard expiry which are equal to each other. But hrtimers with timer slack will have a soft expiry and a hard expiry which is the soft expiry + delta. The slack/delay effect is achieved by splitting the execution of the timer function, and the programming of the next timer event into 2 separate steps.</description>
