This documents how I build www.joelfernandes.org

All that's needed to be done is clone and run build-site.sh
Prerequistes:
apt-get install jekyll
gem install jekyll-paginate

---
However, the following is how I got to that if you want more details:

Unfortunately github doesn't have plugins the site needs to autogen the site, and I don't have to find a way to make them work. So for now, here's what I do:

master branch contains sources
gh-pages branch contains site

jekyll generates output is in _site when doing "jekyll build".
In _site, I have a .git/config which is also available in git-config-gh-pages file in the master branch. In this directory, I do:
git push origin gh-pages

So the flow is:
Edit or add posts to master branch
jekyll serve

rm -rf _site
jekyll build
mkdir -p _site/.git/
cp git-config-gh-pages _site/.git/config
cd _site
git push origin gh-pages
