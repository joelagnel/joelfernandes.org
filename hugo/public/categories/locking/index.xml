      <description>This article tries to clarify how spinlocks are implemented in the Linux kernel and how they should be used correctly in the face of preemption and interrupts. The focus of this article will be more on basic concepts than details, as details tend to be forgotten more easily and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to look up although attention is paid to it to the extent that it helps understanding.&#xA;Fundamentally somewhere in include/linux/spinlock.</description>

      <title>Making sense of scheduler deadlocks in RCU</title>

      <description>Note: At the time of this writing, it is kernel v5.3 release. RCU moves fast and can change in the future, so some details in this article may be obsolete.&#xA;The RCU subsystem and the task scheduler are inter-dependent. They both depend on each other to function correctly. The scheduler has many data structures that are protected by RCU. And, RCU may need to wake up threads to perform things like completing grace periods and callback execution.</description>
