      <description>Recently I asked a question on StackExchange about what happens when 2 voltage signals are tied together. What&amp;rsquo;s the resultant voltage and what decides this voltage? The whole train of thought started when I was trying to contemplate what happens when you use pull-ups on signals that are not Open Drain.&#xA;I create and simulated a Circuit with the same scenario in LTSpice. &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; is the voltage between the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; terminals of V1 and V2 and its shown on the right of the simulation.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to remotely be able to program a MicroSD card with a new bootloader or filesystem without removing the card from its embedded target board (such as a Beaglebone or Pandaboard). Due to the lack of any such existing tools, I decided to design my own board. Finally have got it working, below are some pictures and a screencast demo video of the switcher in action! I sprinkled some power and status LED to show the user what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>
