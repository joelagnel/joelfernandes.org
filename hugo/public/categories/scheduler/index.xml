      <description>TIF_NEED_RESCHED is one of the many &amp;ldquo;thread information flags&amp;rdquo; stored along side every task in the Linux Kernel. One of the flags which is vital to the working of preemption is TIF_NEED_RESCHED. Inorder to explain why its important and how it works, I will go over 2 cases where TIF_NEED_RESCHED is used.&#xA;Preemption Preemption is the process of forceably grabbing CPU from a user or kernel context and giving it to someone else (user or kernel).</description>

      <description>Note: At the time of this writing, it is kernel v5.3 release. RCU moves fast and can change in the future, so some details in this article may be obsolete.&#xA;The RCU subsystem and the task scheduler are inter-dependent. They both depend on each other to function correctly. The scheduler has many data structures that are protected by RCU. And, RCU may need to wake up threads to perform things like completing grace periods and callback execution.</description>
