# About Site

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This website's design is inspired by [Brendan Gregg's beautiful website](https://www.brendangregg.com/), who was kind enough to allow me to reuse some design ideas. Brendan also mentioned that he drew inspiration from the [Nokia Bell Labs Dennis M. Ritchie memorial page](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/dennis-m-ritchie/).
