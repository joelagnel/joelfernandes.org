## Teaching and Mentoring

I have 15 years of experience in the computer science industry and am an avid
public speaker. I have given numerous talks at conferences around the world. I
am particularly excited about breaking down difficult topics into easy to
understand sessions.

I enjoy providing weekly online one-to-one sessions with students who have
reached out to me over the years. Each session is 1 to 1.5 hours and customize
to the student's needs. I strongly believe teaching is re-learning! My style
is often practical as I have both industry and academic experiences.

The following include but are not limited to the classes I teach:
* Computer Architecture.
* Operating Systems and Concurrency.
* Algorithms and Data Structures.
* Advanced Algorithms.
* C, C++, Assembler, Firmware, Python Programming.
* Basics of Computer Programming.
* Computer Networks.
* Digital design, Circuit Design and Embedded Systems.
* Database Design.
* Interview preparation and mock interviews.
* Paper writing.

If there is a Computer Engineering topic above that is not mentioned, or if
there is a academic paper you are reading that you need help with, feel free to
reach out to me to check if I can cover that.

I charge $70/hour for my time, but I can charge a lower fee if you would like to
book a group of sessions. I am also open to group classes with more than 1 student.
