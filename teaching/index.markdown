## Teaching and Mentoring

I have 15 years of experience in the computer science industry and am an avid
public speaker. I have given numerous talks at conferences around the world. I
am particularly excited about breaking down difficult topics into easy to
understand sessions.

I enjoy providing weekly online one-to-one sessions with students who have
reached out to me over the years. Each session is 1 to 1.5 hours and customize
to the student's needs. I strongly believe teaching is re-learning! My style
is often practical as I have both industry and academic experiences.

The following are classes I teach:

* Computer Architecture.

* Operating Systems.

* Advanced Algorithms.

* C, C++, Assembler, Firmware, Python Programming.

* Computer Networks.

* Digital design, Circuit Design and Embedded Systems.

* Circuit Design, Verilog, VHDL programming.

* Database Design.

If there is a Computer Engineering topic above that is not mentioned, or if
there is a academic paper you are reading that you need help with, feel free to
reach out to me to check if I can cover that.

I charge $49/hour for my time, but I can charge a bit less if you would like to
book a group of sessions. Reach out to me on joel @ joelfernandes.org if you
are interested. My contact information is also in my <a href="/joel/joel-resume.pdf">resume</a>.
