## Teaching and Mentoring

I enjoy providing 1:1 sessions with graduate students who have reached out to
me over the years. I strongly believe teaching is re-learning! My style is
often practical as I have both industry and academic experiences.

The following are classes I teach:

* Computer Architecture

* Operating Systems

* C, C++, Assembler, Firmware, Python Programming

* Computer Networks

* Digital design and Embedded Systems.

* Circuit Design, Verilog, VHDL programming.

* Database Design

If there is a Computer Engineering topic above that is not mentioned, or if
there is a academic paper you are reading that you need help with, feel free to
reach out to me to check if I can cover that.

I charge $49/hour for my time, but I can charge a bit less if you would like to
book a group of sessions. Reach out to me on joel @ joelfernandes.org if you
are interested. My contact information is also in my <a href="/joel/joel-resume.pdf">resume</a>.
