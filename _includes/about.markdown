Hello! I'm Joel and this my personal website built with Jekyll! I currently
work at Google. My interests are scheduler, RCU, tracing, synchronization,
memory models and other kernel internals. I also love contributing to the
upstream Linux kernel and other open source projects.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joel_linux), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelagnel). Or, drop me an email at:
joel _at_ joelfernandes _dot_ org

Look for my name in the kernel git log to find my upstream kernel patches.
Check out [my resume](/joel/joel-resume.pdf) for full details of my work
experience. I also actively present at conferences, see a list of my past
[talks, presentations and publications](/resources).
