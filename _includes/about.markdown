Hello! I'm Joel and I run this site! I work in the Android kernel team at Google. My interests are scheduler, tracing, synchronization and kernel internals. I also love contributing to the upstream Linux kernel and other open source projects.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joel_linux), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelagnel). Or, drop me an email at: joel _at_ joelfernandes _dot_ org

[Here's a list](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/LKML/list/?submitter=170577) of recent kernel patches I submitted. I got [featured on hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2014/06/08/the-in-circuit-sd-card-switch/) and [have written for LWN](https://lwn.net/Articles/744522/) as well. [Check out my resume](/joel/joel-resume.pdf) and also see a list of past [talks/presentations](/resources).

**[LinuxInternals.org](/linuxinternals/)** is a resource I created as a collection of articles and resources exploring Linux kernel and internals topics.
