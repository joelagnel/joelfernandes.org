There's something magical about New York City. The energy is unlike anywhere else - millions of people from every corner of the world, all pursuing their dreams in this concrete jungle.

I love walking through Central Park, grabbing a slice of pizza at 2am, and the way the skyline lights up at dusk. The city that never sleeps has a way of making you feel like anything is possible.
