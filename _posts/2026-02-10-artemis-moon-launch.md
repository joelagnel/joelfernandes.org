The Artemis II mission is finally happening - humans are going back to the Moon for the first time since 1972. I'm genuinely excited about this, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous too. There's something about watching that massive rocket with actual people inside that makes my stomach churn.

The launch date has been pushed to sometime in March 2026. I'm holding a watch party at home and have had to keep canceling on my friends and moving the date - frustrating, but that's space for you. Originally scheduled for early February, NASA encountered a liquid hydrogen leak during the "wet dress rehearsal." This is a full countdown simulation where they actually fuel the rocket with cryogenic propellants (hence "wet") and run through all the pre-launch procedures, stopping just before engine ignition. Apollo had the same practice - they called it the "Countdown Demonstration Test" (CDDT). Apollo 11 did theirs in early July 1969, just weeks before launch. Specific launch windows now include March 6-9 and March 11, with backup opportunities in April.

## How Big Is This Thing?

The SLS rocket stands 322 feet tall (98 meters). To put that in perspective for my fellow New Yorkers and recent visitors:

- **Taller than the Statue of Liberty** - Lady Liberty from the ground to the torch is 305 feet. SLS has her beat by 17 feet.
- **Taller than the Flatiron Building** - That iconic triangular building in Manhattan is 285 feet. The rocket would tower over it.
- **Nearly a football field on its side** - A football field is 360 feet. Lay the SLS down and it almost reaches end to end.
- **About 30 stories** - If it were an apartment building, you'd need a really good elevator.

And this massive structure produces 8.8 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. For comparison, the Saturn V that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon produced 7.5 million pounds. We're strapping four people to the most powerful rocket NASA has ever launched for a crewed mission.

## Safety First - Why It Took So Long

If you've ever wondered why it took over 50 years to get humans back to the Moon, the answer is largely "safety." And honestly, that's probably a good thing.

Back in the Apollo days, the Space Race was a geopolitical sprint. NASA's mantra was "Failure is Not an Option," but they took risks that would be considered completely unacceptable today. If one piece of hardware failed during descent, the astronauts' chances of survival were low. We got lucky more times than we'd like to admit.

The Artemis program operates under a completely different philosophy. Every piece of hardware has triple redundancy. We're no longer trying to beat the Soviet Union - we're trying to build a reliable transportation system for sustained human presence in deep space.

### The Launch Abort System

One of the most impressive safety features is the Launch Abort System (LAS) - that slender tower mounted above the crew module. If something goes wrong during launch, this thing can respond in milliseconds to pull the astronauts to safety.

The 44-foot-tall LAS uses three solid-rocket motors working in sequence:

1. **Abort motor** - fires first to deliver a rapid, powerful pull that separates the Orion crew module from the rocket
2. **Attitude control motor** - steers the crew module to a controlled flight path away from potential hazards
3. **Jettison motor** - discards the LAS once Orion is in a safe position

Unlike "pusher" designs where engines below the capsule push it away, Orion's LAS is a "puller" configuration. This design puts the abort motor farther from the crew and provides better aerodynamic stability during the most intense phases of launch.

The LAS is active from the moment the crew boards until about 3 minutes after launch, when Orion is safely through the most dangerous part of ascent. At that point, the jettison motor fires and the entire abort system is discarded - no point carrying 16,000 pounds of dead weight to the Moon. During Artemis I in 2022, the jettison worked perfectly (the abort motor was inert since no crew was aboard). The system has also been tested in 2010 (pad abort) and 2019 (ascent abort during flight conditions).

## What Are They Actually Doing?

Here's something that surprised me when I first learned about it - they're not landing on the Moon. Artemis II is a flyby mission. The crew will:

- Launch aboard the SLS rocket from Kennedy Space Center
- Orbit Earth twice to test systems
- Head toward the Moon
- Travel around the Moon, getting as close as 8,000 km (5,000 miles) from the lunar surface
- Return to Earth and splash down in the Pacific Ocean

The whole mission takes about 10 days. The primary objective is to demonstrate that all the systems work correctly with humans aboard - life support, environmental controls, the heat shield, communications, and navigation.

The actual Moon landing comes with Artemis III, currently targeted for 2028. That mission will send astronauts to the lunar south pole - a completely different destination than the equatorial regions where Apollo landed. Why the south pole? Water ice. Billions of tons of it sitting in permanently shadowed craters. Water means drinking, agriculture, and rocket fuel. It's the difference between camping and homesteading.

## The New Space Race

Neil deGrasse Tyson has [famously argued](https://www.slashgear.com/898430/how-neil-degrasse-tyson-feels-about-the-privatization-of-space-exploration/) that major space exploration - getting to the Moon or Mars - requires government backing, not private enterprise alone. The endeavor is too costly, too dangerous, and defies every common-sense business model. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are great for "hauling groceries" to the ISS and space tourism, but pushing the frontier? That takes government-scale resources and risk tolerance.

Well, it looks like we have our motivation again. China has announced it's [on track to land humans on the Moon by 2030](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/11/china-is-going-to-the-moon-by-2030-heres-whats-known.html). Their "Lanyue" (meaning "embracing the moon") lander has already completed touchdown and takeoff tests. Just like the Soviet Union pushed us to the Moon in the 1960s, China is pushing us back.

The race is on. And that's probably a good thing for space exploration, even if the motivations are geopolitical rather than purely scientific.

## Why This Is Harder Than Apollo

You might think that with 50+ years of technological advancement, this should be easy. It's not. Here's why:

**The destination is harder.** Apollo landed on flat, bright equatorial plains - the "safe" parking spots. Artemis III is targeting the lunar south pole with its rough terrain and extreme shadows. Much harder to navigate and land.

**The standards are higher.** In the 1960s, astronaut safety was important but not absolute. Today, everything is broadcast in 4K and analyzed in real-time by millions of people. The tolerance for risk is much, much lower.

**The mission is more complex.** Apollo was "get there and back." Artemis is building infrastructure - the Lunar Gateway station will orbit the Moon as a staging point. We're not just visiting; we're setting up shop.

**We know more about the dangers.** Long-term radiation exposure, lunar dust damage to equipment and lungs, the psychological effects of extended isolation - we understand these risks better now, which means we have to address them.

**The landing system is different.** Artemis III will use SpaceX's Starship HLS - a massive, reusable craft that needs to be refueled in orbit before heading to the Moon. That's an additional layer of complexity Apollo didn't have to deal with.

## Fingers Crossed

I'll be watching the launch with a mix of excitement and anxiety. Four astronauts - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen - will be strapped into that Orion capsule atop 8.8 million pounds of thrust.

The technology is better than ever. The safety systems are more sophisticated than anything we've built before. The teams at NASA, SpaceX, and Lockheed Martin have spent years preparing for this moment.

But space is hard. And putting humans on top of a controlled explosion will always be nerve-wracking, no matter how much we prepare.

Fingers crossed 🤞
