Just moved to Charlottesville, Virginia last year and I'm still getting used to the weather here. Today it's a crisp winter morning - temperature hovering around 35°F. The Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance have a light dusting of snow.

Coming from the DC area (Manassas), the weather here is pretty similar but somehow feels more "country" - quieter, cleaner air, and you can actually see the stars at night.

The Shenandoah National Park is just a short drive away, which is great for hiking when the weather warms up. Looking forward to exploring more trails this spring!
